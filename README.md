## Introduction

Informed decision-making is critical to facilitating sustainable urban development as urban populations grow larger. Using geospatial data and energy simulation tools, Urban Building Energy Models (UBEM) can provide data-driven decision support for architects, urban planners, and energy policymakers.  A crucial part of developing an accurate UBEM is the seamless integration of high-quality aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR), digital elevation models (DEM), building stock, and weather data​. These data are fundamental for solar rooftop potential analysis and simulation-based energy consumption estimation​. In this study, we aim to streamline and optimize the creation of urban building models using publicly available datasets for the purpose of UBEM simulations. We do this by using an automated 3D model creation workflow that consists of requesting geospatial datasets via open APIs and processing these data using platform-independent software libraries.
